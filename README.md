# Competitive Programming

## Skills
* Quickly solving easy problems - solving problems you know how to
  * Fastforces
* Solving hard problems - solving problems you don't know how to

## Advice
* If you're targeting a rating X, solve problems that are X + 300 with a spread of 100 => {X + 200, X + 300, X + 400}
* Ways to practice
  * Solving easy problems fast
  * Solving hard problems slow (to eventually be solved fast)
