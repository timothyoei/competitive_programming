# Competitive Programming
A place for storing solutions, templates, and advice (not by me) for competitive programming.

## Advice
* "If you're targeting a rating X, solve problems that are X + 300 with a spread of 100 => {X + 200, X + 300, X + 400}" - Yongwhan Lim
* "In archives you learn how to solve problems, in contests you learn how to do it fast." - Um_nik
